Hi all, here I bring my 10th tutorial of Istio step-by-step. This tutorial is based on my second article (istio-step-by-step-part-02-getting-started-with-istio), which was written based on Istio 1.0.2 version. But new Istio 1.4, has many changes starting from installation. So, please refer to this article if you are using the latest version of Istio (1.4).

### Step 04

Installing Istio. This is the final step. New Istio has configuration profiles for installing Istio. There are few build-in configuration profiles,

1. default ‚Äî this will enable the default settings of Istio **control plane**.

1. demo ‚Äî this profile is to show the key functions in Istio. Bookinfo application and the tasks associated with it can be executed with this profile. *(We are going to move on in this article with this application)*

1. minimal ‚Äî this has the minimal configuration set for Istio traffic routing.

1. sds ‚Äî(SDS-Secret Discovery Service) this profile is a bit similar to the default profile. But this profile comes with few additional authentication features which are enabled by default (Strict Mutual TLS). These features enable Istio‚Äôs SDS.

1. remote ‚Äî this profile is used when working with remote clusters in a multicluster mesh which shares single control plane configurations.
