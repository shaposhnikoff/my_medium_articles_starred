# Deploying Docker Images to Cloud Run using Terraform


> # In this article, weâ€™ll deploy a serverless Flask web application to Cloud Run by building its [Docker image](https://github.com/Timtech4u/ghost3-docker) into Container Registry and use Terraform to provision our deployment as code.
> [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) is a infrastructure as code tool for building, changing, and versioning infrastructure safely and efficiently across various cloud providers.
> [Cloud Run](https://cloud.google.com/run/) is a managed compute platform that enables you to run stateless serverless containers that automatically scales.
> [Container Registry](https://cloud.google.com/container-registry) is a private container image registry that runs on Google Cloud.
> [Flask](https://github.com/pallets/flask) is a micro web framework written in Python.

## Prerequisites

* Create a [Google Cloud Platform (GCP) project](https://console.cloud.google.com/project), or use an existing one.

* Setup [Cloud SDK](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/), or use [Cloud Shell](https://cloud.google.com/shell/).

* Enable the [Cloud Run API](https://console.developers.google.com/apis/api/run.googleapis.com/overview).

* Enable the [Container Registry API](https://console.developers.google.com/apis/api/containerregistry.googleapis.com/overview).

* Clone the [sample codes](https://github.com/Timtech4u/flask-docker) or setup your own codes with a *Dockerfile*.

For this guide, I would stick to using Cloud Shell which has Terraform enabled by default.

If you are using the Cloud SDK on your local PC, you need a service account to use Terraform, do create one [here](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials/serviceaccountkey).

*Note that **terraform-cr **is my GCP project ID and you should replace that with yours.*

## Pushing Docker Image to Container Registry

We need to build the Docker image and push it to the projectâ€™s container registry so Terraform can access it.

You can clone the source codes into Cloud Shell and execute the following commands within itâ€™s directory.

    $ docker build -t gcr.io/terraform-cr/webapp .
    $ docker push gcr.io/terraform-cr/webapp

If this didnâ€™t work for you, do check out other steps on the official documentation [here](https://cloud.google.com/container-registry/docs/pushing-and-pulling).

Cloud Run will only retrieve containers hosted in Container Registry and not from other sources.

If your Docker Image is on [Docker Hub](http://hub.docker.com/), I made a short video that narrates how to push a Docker Image to Container Registry. Do subscribe ðŸ˜‰

## Deploying to Cloud Run using Terraform

Terraform is enabled on Cloud Shell, you can verify by executing the ***terraform -v ***command. The version of Terraform installed is v0.12.9.

![Terraform version](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*TgCaXl1nVkw99ARRjWLG6g.png)*Terraform version*

If you want to find out more details on this section, do checkout [Cloud Run - Terraform resource documentation](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/google/r/cloud_run_service.html).

Next step is to create a **main.tf** file which is a Terraform configuration file, you can find mine here:

    # Filename: main.tf

    # Configure GCP project
    provider "google" {
      project = "terraform-cr"
    }

    # Deploy image to Cloud Run
    resource "google_cloud_run_service" "mywebapp" {
      name     = "mywebapp"
      location = "us-central1"
      template {
        spec {
          containers {
            image = "gcr.io/terraform-cr/webapp"
          }
        }
      }
      traffic {
        percent         = 100
        latest_revision = true
      }
    }

    # Create public access
    data "google_iam_policy" "noauth" {
      binding {
        role = "roles/run.invoker"
        members = [
          "allUsers",
        ]
      }
    }

    # Enable public access on Cloud Run service
    resource "google_cloud_run_service_iam_policy" "noauth" {
      location    = google_cloud_run_service.mywebapp.location
      project     = google_cloud_run_service.mywebapp.project
      service     = google_cloud_run_service.mywebapp.name
      policy_data = data.google_iam_policy.noauth.policy_data
    }

    # Return service URL
    output "url" {
      value = "${google_cloud_run_service.mywebapp.status[0].url}"
    }

Now letâ€™s initialize Terraform on Google Cloud Shell.

    $ terraform init

![Output](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*gqPXlWuvIpabg26YdMS_dg.png)*Output*

Then letâ€™s plan the code in our **main.tf **file and see what the infrastructure looks like:

    $ terraform plan

![Truncated Output](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*SZLjZpScDhwaGdQQPA0p4g.png)*Truncated Output*

Finally, we can apply to execute, make sure to enter â€˜**yes**â€™ to approve.

    $ terraform apply

![Truncated Output](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*tj5Xuj8JymgyStzP1nE6lw.png)*Truncated Output*

    Outputs:

    url = [https://mywebapp-mxxduub7tq-uc.a.run.app](https://mywebapp-mxxduub7tq-uc.a.run.app)

## Next Steps

Terraform allows you delete every resource used (including the GCP project), to do this, execute the following command, make sure to enter â€˜**yes**â€™ to approve.

    $ terraform destroy

So far we have been able to use Terraform to provision our deployment to Cloud Run as code. This could help you deploy applications much faster.
