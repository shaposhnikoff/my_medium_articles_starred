**Let’s start!**

### Install & Configure Python Virtual Environment

I’m using Ubuntu, so the installation steps could be used for Ubuntu, Debian and Ubuntu/Debian based distributions. For other OSs, you can find more information [here](https://stackoverflow.com/a/6587528), and in the [official website of Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

    sudo apt-get install python3
    sudo apt-get install python3-pip
    sudo pip3 install virtualenv
    mkdir -p serverless-python-examples/hello-world/app
    cd serverless-python-examples/hello-world

Create a virtual environment and activate it:

    virtualenv -p python3 venv
    . venv/bin/activate

Our working directory is

    serverless-python-examples/hello-world/app

### Create an AWS User for Your Application

The second step is signing in to your AWS console and creating a new user. (You can also use a user you already created) :

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3798/1*ctnt0PlCsqADriMYP91mdg.png)

Now add the permissions you need for the created user. In my case, I am going to choose the Administration permission (arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AdministratorAccess) that provides full access to AWS services and resources.

**Note:** When thinking about security, the administrator access is not a good choice, you can refine your user permissions by choosing only the AWS permissions you need.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3810/1*9sV1ZjmuwFORQws0cuLxAA.png)

Please keep in mind that you must download and keep the generated credentials in a safe place:

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3812/1*c7GzdmSwS7aeUaHgLdewLw.png)

For the sake of simplicity, I added a new profile to the file

    ~/.aws/credentials

with the name

    serverless

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*mVwju6xdWlXSCPdfJ1Eleg.png)

By adding the credentials to the AWS credentials file, I can use any AWS command using the desired profile.

Example:

    aws s3 cp my_file s3://my_bucket --profile serverless

### Installing and Configuring Serverless Framework

You can install Serverless using a single command:

    sudo npm install -g serverless

Let’s configure Serverless:

    serverless config credentials --provider aws --key <ACCESS KEY ID> --secret <SECRET KEY>

If you stored the key/secret to the credential files, we can use the different Serverless commands by designtating the profile at each command:

    serverless deploy --aws-profile serverless

We can also export the profile as well as the region to environement variables:

    export AWS_PROFILE="serverless" && export AWS_REGION=eu-west-1

### Initializing our Project

In the app folder, we need to create a serverless.yml file. This file is needed to configure how our application will behave.

We need also to create our Python function (called handler.py):

In order to do this, let’s execute this command:

    serverless create --template aws-python3 --name hello-world

This will create the handler file, the configuration file and the .gitignore file:

    .
    ├── .gitignore
    ├── handler.py
    └── serverless.yml

This is how our serverless.yml file looks like:

    provider:
      name: aws
      runtime: python3.6

    functions:
      hello:
        handler: handler.hello

This is how the handler.py file looks like:

    import json

    def hello(event, context):
        body = {
            "message": "Go Serverless v1.0! Your function executed successfully!",
            "input": event
        }

    response = {
            "statusCode": 200,
            "body": json.dumps(body)
        }

    return response

    # Use this code if you don't use the http event with the LAMBDA-PROXY
        # integration
        """
        return {
            "message": "Go Serverless v1.0! Your function executed successfully!",
            "event": event
        }
        """

### Deploying our Project

Once the template files are created, we have a working AWS Lambda function, we need to deploy it:

    export AWS_PROFILE="serverless"
    serverless deploy

Note: You need to change the profile name to use your own one.

The deployment output looks like this. You can see that our code is zipped and deployed to a S3 bucket before being deployed to Lambda.

    Service Information

    api keys:
      None
    endpoints:
      None
    functions:
      hello: hello-world-dev-hello

The function is now deployed.

### Adding Events to our Function

While you *do* already have a function defined called hello that's linked to a function handler, you currently have no way of triggering that function. That's why we need to add an event to the function defined in serverless.yml. Update it as follows:

We defined a function called hello but we did not define a way to trigger the function, this is when adding an “event” is useful. Edit the serverless.yml file:

    provider:
      name: aws
      runtime: python3.6

    functions:
      hello:
        handler: handler.hello
    **    events:
          - http:
              path: hello
              method: get**

According to our configuration, the function will be called using the /hello url.

Note: You can choose your own url.

Let’s deploy:

    serverless deploy -v

    functions:

    ServerlessDeploymentBucketName: hello-world-dev-serverlessdeploymentbucket-qqgrblrjprhu

As you may see in the deployment logs that the AWS lambda function has a new URL:

    [https://x7o0xwsbkd.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/dev/hello](https://x7o0xwsbkd.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/dev/hello)

We can test our function using the browser, tools like Postman, the CLI or Serverless invoke command.

**Using CURL:**

    curl -X GET [https://x7o0xwsbkd.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/dev/hello](https://x7o0xwsbkd.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/dev/hello)

Output:

          },
          "body":null,
          "isBase64Encoded":false
       }
    }

**Using serverless invoke:**

    sls invoke -f hello

Output:

    {
        "statusCode": 200,
        "body": "{\"message\": \"Go Serverless v1.0! Your function executed successfully!\", \"input\": {}}"
    }

### Tailing Logs

Sometimes, you need to see the execution or the deployment logs. This is the command to tail the logs:

    sls logs -f hello --tail

### Deleting the Function

Using sls remove command, we can delete the deployed service from AWS Lambda.

    serverless remove

We can add other options like:

* --stage or -s The name of the stage in service.

* --region or -r The name of the region in stage.

* --verbose or -v Shows all stack events during deployment.

Note: Removing a service will also remove the S3 bucket.
