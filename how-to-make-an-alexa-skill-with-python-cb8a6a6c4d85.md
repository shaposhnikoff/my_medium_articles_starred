# How to make an Alexa Skill with Python

This guide will assume that you have already completed the Alexa Python Tutorial from Amazon. If you have done this then you should have a good handle on how to create new Alexa Skills and Lambda functions. But you probably still have no idea how to write code for an Alexa Skill. The code for ‚Äúalexa-skills-kit-color-expert-python‚Äù is almost unreadable. Maybe Amazon should hire me to write tutorials. üòú Seriously, if you really like this tutorial tell the Alexa Devs they should hire me to make more.

This tutorial will show you a template with some nice clean readable code. The full code for this template is on [GitHub](https://github.com/jrigden/alexa_template). Additionally the tutorial is also available in video form on [Mr. Rigden‚Äôs Channel on Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8QCO0YWJRY&list=PLLlMDtI0KL5pK4-6N4hGK7_wwayF_naDG)

## JSON Everywhere

Almost everything you will be dealing with is JSON. Check out the ‚ÄúJ[SON Interface Reference for Custom Skills](https://developer.amazon.com/public/solutions/alexa/alexa-skills-kit/docs/alexa-skills-kit-interface-reference)‚Äù as a reference. Those JSON objects will be represented by Python dictionaries. You will be seeing many dictionaries within dictionaries.

## The Lambda Function

Lambda functions start with lambda_handler function. Think of it like a main().

    def lambda_handler(event, context):
        if event['request']['type'] == "LaunchRequest":
            return on_launch(event, context)

        elif event['request']['type'] == "IntentRequest":
            return intent_router(event, context)

This function is given two arguments: event, context. event is a Python dictionary. First we check event[‚Äòrequest‚Äô][‚Äòtype‚Äô]* *to see what type of request we have received. [Standard Request Types](https://developer.amazon.com/public/solutions/alexa/alexa-skills-kit/docs/custom-standard-request-types-reference) can be one of three values:

* [LaunchRequest](https://developer.amazon.com/public/solutions/alexa/alexa-skills-kit/docs/custom-standard-request-types-reference#launchrequest)

* [IntentRequest](https://developer.amazon.com/public/solutions/alexa/alexa-skills-kit/docs/custom-standard-request-types-reference#intentrequest)

* [SessionEndedRequest](https://developer.amazon.com/public/solutions/alexa/alexa-skills-kit/docs/custom-standard-request-types-reference#sessionendedrequest)

## on_launch

This happens when the skill is invoked with no intent. When called, Alexa will say, ‚ÄúThis is the body‚Äù. It will also create a card with the title, ‚ÄúThis is the title‚Äù. In this function we see out first helper function from the template. The statement function.

    def on_launch(event, context):
        return statement("This is the title", "This is the body")

## statement

This is a simple helper function that builds a response. It takes a title and a body. It uses these to build the [spoken output](https://developer.amazon.com/public/solutions/alexa/alexa-skills-kit/docs/alexa-skills-kit-interface-reference#outputspeech-object) and the [card output](https://developer.amazon.com/public/solutions/alexa/alexa-skills-kit/docs/alexa-skills-kit-interface-reference#card-object).

    def statement(title, body):
        speechlet = {}
        speechlet['outputSpeech'] = build_PlainSpeech(body)
        speechlet['card'] = build_SimpleCard(title, body)
        speechlet['shouldEndSession'] = True
        return build_response(speechlet)

In this function we create a dictionary. Remember, these dictionaries will be turned into JSON objects. We give the key outputSpeech the value returned by build_PlainSpeech. We give the key card the value returned by build_SimpleCard. And we set the key shouldEndSession to True. Then we give that dictionary to build_response and return the result.

Let‚Äôs deconstruct some of the functions called here.

## build_PlainSpeech

This function builds the [OutputSpeech](https://developer.amazon.com/public/solutions/alexa/alexa-skills-kit/docs/alexa-skills-kit-interface-reference#outputspeech-object) object.

    def build_PlainSpeech(body):
        speech = {}
        speech['type'] = 'PlainText'
        speech['text'] = body
        return speech

## build_SimpleCard

This function builds the [Card](https://developer.amazon.com/public/solutions/alexa/alexa-skills-kit/docs/alexa-skills-kit-interface-reference#card-object) object. Cards need titles.

    def build_SimpleCard(title, body):
        card = {}
        card['type'] = 'Simple'
        card['title'] = title
        card['content'] = body
        return card

## build_response

This function builds the [Response body](https://developer.amazon.com/public/solutions/alexa/alexa-skills-kit/docs/alexa-skills-kit-interface-reference#response-body-syntax).

    def build_response(message, session_attributes={}):
        response = {}
        response['version'] = '1.0'
        response['sessionAttributes'] = session_attributes
        response['response'] = message
        return response

## intent_router

This happens when the skill is invoked with an intent. We need to do another check now. This time we need to route the right intent to the right function. I am assigning event[‚Äòrequest‚Äô][‚Äòintent‚Äô][‚Äòname‚Äô] to intent just for readability. Those nested dictionaries can get hard to read.

    def intent_router(event, context):
        intent = event['request']['intent']['name']

        # Custom Intents

        if intent == "SingIntent":
            return sing_intent(event, context)

        if intent == "TripIntent":
            return trip_intent(event, context)

        if intent == "CounterIntent":
            return counter_intent(event, context)

        # Required Intents

        if intent == "AMAZON.CancelIntent":
            return cancel_intent()

        if intent == "AMAZON.HelpIntent":
            return help_intent()

        if intent == "AMAZON.StopIntent":
            return stop_intent()

You may have noticed that I skipped over adding intents to the Alexa Skill Kit interface. This is a bit beyond the scope of this tutorial. The Skill Builder is complex. For now just open the Builder‚Äôs code editor and paste in the code from [intents.json](https://github.com/jrigden/alexa_template/blob/master/intents.json) from the GitHub repo. There are many good guides for the Skill Builder available online.

Let‚Äôs talk a look at some of these functions.

## sing_intent

This function gets called when we receive the SingIntent. It uses the statement function from earlier to sing a short song to the user.

    def sing_intent(event, context):
        song = "Daisy, Daisy. Give me your answer, do. I'm half crazy all for the love of you"
        return statement("daisy_bell_intent", song)

## trip_intent

This function gets called when we receive the TripIntent. This intent uses the [Dialog Model](https://developer.amazon.com/public/solutions/alexa/alexa-skills-kit/docs/ask-define-the-vui-with-gui#define-dialog). A dialog helps the collection multipart data by asking follow up questions. We need to return a [Delegate Directive](http://Delegate Directive) to continue the dialog.

We check the dialogState. If it is STARTED or IN_PROGRESS we call the continue_dialog function. When the dialogState is COMPLETED, we can access the information in the slots.

    def trip_intent(event, context):
        dialog_state = event['request']['dialogState']

        if dialog_state in ("STARTED", "IN_PROGRESS"):
            return continue_dialog()

        elif dialog_state == "COMPLETED":
            return statement("trip_intent", "Have a good trip")

        else:
            return statement("trip_intent", "No dialog")

## continue_dialog

This function creates and returns a Dialog.Delegate.

    def continue_dialog():
        message = {}
        message['shouldEndSession'] = False
        message['directives'] = [{'type': 'Dialog.Delegate'}]
        return build_response(message)

## counter_intent

This function gets called when we receive the CounterIntent. This function introduces the [Session object](https://developer.amazon.com/public/solutions/alexa/alexa-skills-kit/docs/alexa-skills-kit-interface-reference#session-object) and the template‚Äôs conversation function. The session allows us store key value pairs in event[‚Äòsession‚Äô][‚Äòattributes‚Äô] . These key value pairs disappear at the end of a session.

In this function we are incrementing a counter in the session. Then we return the result of template‚Äôs conversation function.

    def counter_intent(event, context):
        session_attributes = event['session']['attributes']
    
        if "counter" in session_attributes:
            session_attributes['counter'] += 1
    
        else:
            session_attributes['counter'] = 1
    
        return conversation("counter_intent",
                            session_attributes['counter'],
                            session_attributes)

## conversation

This function is very similar to the statement function. It does two thing differently. First it sets the shouldEndSession to False, because we want to continue the session. It also sends back the session in the response. This maintains the information in the session.

    def conversation(title, body, session_attributes):
        speechlet = {}
        speechlet['outputSpeech'] = build_PlainSpeech(body)
        speechlet['card'] = build_SimpleCard(title, body)
        speechlet['shouldEndSession'] = False
        return build_response(speechlet,
                              session_attributes=session_attributes)

## **Conclusion**

I hope you found this useful. Although this was not an complete guide to making Alexa Skill with Python, it should get you started. Go out there and make awesome Alexa Skills! If you publish a skill send it to me. I would love to try it out.
