# 100 Days of DevOps — Day 0

D-day is just one day away and finally, this is a continuation of the post(I posted a month earlier)

*Motivation*medium.com](https://medium.com/@devopslearning/100-days-of-devops-81faf13bf772)

*The main ideology behind it, rather than posting a bunch of theoretical concepts every day, post a problem which we face in day to day life and how to solve it.*

*It can be related to any topics*

** AWS
* GCP
* Python
* Jenkins
* GIT
* Kubernetes
* Docker
* Shell Script
* Linux
* Terraform 
* ….*

*and then post the progress via*
