# Securing gRPC Microservices with Istio Service Mesh



Recently we started a meetup group targeting IAM developers in 7 locations globally: [Mountain View](https://www.meetup.com/IAM-for-developers-Silicon-Valley/), [Toronto](https://www.meetup.com/IAM-for-Developers-Toronto/), [London](https://www.meetup.com/IAM-for-Developers-London/), [Sydney](https://www.meetup.com/IAM-for-Developers-Sydney/), [Singapore](https://www.meetup.com/IAM-for-Developers-singapore/) , [Bangalore](https://www.meetup.com/IAM-for-Developers-Bangalore/) and [Colombo](https://www.meetup.com/IAM-for-Developers-Colombo/). In the following session I did at the 7th IAM4Developers meetup, I talked about securing gRPC microservices with Istio in a Kubernetes deployment.
